# Project Documentation

## Solution Integrity
The project aims to provide a complete and functional solution for managing and displaying products in an e-commerce setting. The key functionalities include:
- **Product Listing Page**: Fetching and displaying products dynamically, with filtering by category.
- **Product Detail Page**: Fetching and displaying a single product’s details based on the selected product.
- **Navigation & Routing**: Implementing Next.js dynamic routes for smooth navigation between product listings and detail pages.
- **Testing Coverage**: Comprehensive testing using **Jest** for unit tests and **Cypress** for end-to-end (E2E) testing.

Despite some challenges encountered during testing, the solution ensures proper API handling, UI responsiveness, and error handling mechanisms to maintain solution integrity.

## Design Considerations
### Functionality
- **Next.js Framework**: Utilized for server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG) where appropriate.
- **React Functional Components**: The project follows modern React practices with hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`, and `useRouter`).
- **Material-UI**: Used for styling and layout consistency, providing an accessible and scalable design.

### Readability & Maintainability
- **Component-Based Structure**: Encapsulation of logic into separate React components for better reusability.
- **Consistent Code Formatting**: Enforced with ESLint and Prettier to maintain readable and structured code.
- **API Abstraction**: API requests are abstracted into a separate module (`api.ts`), allowing easier modifications and scalability.

### Extendability
- **Modular Architecture**: The structure allows for easy addition of new features, such as user authentication, cart functionality, or payment integration.
- **Dynamic Routing**: The project supports future expansion by utilizing Next.js’s file-based routing.
- **Test Scalability**: The testing framework is designed to accommodate additional components and functionalities as they evolve.

## Testability
The project employs a robust testing strategy to ensure functionality and prevent regressions:

### Unit Testing (Jest & React Testing Library)
- **Component Tests**: Ensures each component behaves as expected.
- **API Tests**: Verifies API fetch functions return correct data.
- **Mocking**: API responses are mocked using `jest.fn()` to avoid network dependencies.

### End-to-End Testing (Cypress)
- **Navigation Tests**: Ensures users can navigate between pages.
- **UI Interaction Tests**: Verifies user interactions, such as clicking on product cards.
- **Error Handling**: Tests cases where the API returns failures.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates a well-structured and scalable Next.js application with effective design patterns, robust test coverage, and a focus on maintainability. Future enhancements could include caching strategies, improved API error handling, and performance optimizations.
